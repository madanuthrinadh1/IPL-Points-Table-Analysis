The project analyzes the points table of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 season, scraped from the Cricbuzz website. It extracts relevant data such as team names, matches played, won, lost, and points, and processes it using NumPy and Pandas. The processed data is then visualized in the form of a bar chart, illustrating the number of wins and losses for each team. The project provides a clear and concise overview of the IPL 2020 points table, making it easy to understand and compare the performance of different teams.
